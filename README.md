Domotic Motel ERP



*** Overview :**

This project aims to implement the functionality of an ERP dedicated to the management of a Motel
with the addition of home automation functionality.

It comes from a real need expressed by a friend who carries out this activity and that more
wishes to automate some processes in order to achieve energy savings.

The purely managerial part of the application manages a very specific workflow for this particular
type of hotel.
In summary, these are structures that provide an accommodation service to those who travel for long periods
stretches and needs to be able to stop for a few hours or for the whole night and then resume the journey.

It is therefore quite different to the typical holiday and leisure hotel structures that I am normally used to.

Beyond that, the scenario is that of African countries where energy resources are precious.

The home automation integration has in fact the task of automatically managing the switching on and off of electrical services such as
Lighting, sockets and air conditioning according to the time of stay and cleaning and maintenance activities.
