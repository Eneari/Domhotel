OTA updater for ESP32 running Micropython by David Flory.
Tutorial: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-micropython-ota-updates/

A simple program to demonstrate OTA update functionality in conjunction with main.py
The program can be as simple or complicated as you like, but must contain these functions.
The variable 'url' should be the full web address to the location of the update file and the PHP script which
returns it. below is the PHP script, named 'get_ESP_data.php'.

<?php
    $file = $_GET['file'];
    $dir = getcwd();
    $file = $dir.'/'.$file;
    $myfile = fopen($file, "r") or die("FAIL");
    echo file_get_contents($file);
    fclose($myfile);
?>

The script reads the update file and echo's it back in response to the request made by the
'check_for_updates' function.

Here is the delete script for deleting the updates.
<?php
    $file = $_GET['file'];
    $dir = getcwd();
    $file = $dir.'/'.$file;
    unlink($file);
?>
